<h1 align="center">Coffee Houses of Nashville</h1>

<p align="center">This project was written as an early application in my full-stack web developer bootcamp at Nashville Software School (NSS) and uses basic HTML and basic CSS. It was done and completed in my first few days at NSS, so the quality is very low.</p>
